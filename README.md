# World expansion: Field of Dreams
There is not much in this mod yet, but in the future it will add more new plants, mechanisms, biomes and structures!
The essence of fashion is that these are not the most common plants for the garden. Each of them has its own feature that adds interest to the game, and in the future these plants will be used in whole factories!

The mod is in beta testing!


Changes in version 0.0.1

 Plants
- Grapes
It needs to be planted in the garden near the fence, otherwise it will not grow. when bunches of grapes appear on it, it will be possible to collect a new type of food - Grapes.
At the moment, the grapes have no functionality other than the functionality of food, but later other items will be created from it.
- Rosehip
When it is extracted, the player receives rosehip berries (for now it is also just food, but then the functionality will increase). Rosehip can be obtained only by clicking on a rose bush with bone meal (in the future in a new swamp biome), while fallen petals appear around it with some probability, which are simply used to obtain wheat seeds and fertilizer for composting. Under the briar itself, a new block appears - peat. In it, the player falls a couple of pixels, jumps lower, and also slows down. Peat can be used in the furnace and as a fertilizer for composting, or pieces of peat can be made from it, which can also be used in the furnace and as a fertilizer for composting.
- Reeds
- a plant that appears on beaches. When mining, the player gets from 1 to 3 cattails, which can be used with the right mouse button and with some chance to get from 0 to 3 fluff (while without functionality, it will appear in the future). Also, when mining cane, the player receives from 2 to 3 sticks of cane. If the player uses it on a block of mud from a mangrove swamp, it will be replaced with adobe (dry) mud. This can also be done using wheat instead of cane. this adds adobe dirt crafting not through inventory, but through the game world.

 Block
-Wine rack
It is made of spruce boards in the middle row from top to bottom and spruce boards from top and bottom left, as well as from top and bottom right.
It has no functionality yet (almost). Most likely, this is the first block that will be finalized from all the blocks of this beta version.

 +New Year's content+
- Decorate a garland
with a block that just glows, and when you right-click, it starts to "sparkle" with sounds. It is made of a lantern or shower lamp in the middle, any glass from the bottom in the middle, right in the middle and left in the middle and threads on top.
- Gifts
There are 3 gifts: red, turquoise and black. They differ in texture and model. Clicking on any of them opens the interface with 9 slots and plays the sound. They are made of matching wool in the center from the bottom, right and left, yellow wool in the center and thread from the top in the center.
